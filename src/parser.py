## parser.py

"""
This aims to be a parser for a language with similar syntax to that written in Fun_Language_Example.txt
For personal simplicity, I intend to adjust the language slightly so that every variable/function definition
has the let keyword before it. This allows for simple block parsing â€” blocks can easily be identified by
simply splitting the code into blocks separated by keywords, and then parsing the blocks separately with
parsing rules depending on the keyword prefixing the block. Early on, the only two keywords of this form
will be "let" and "type". This will probably be extended once something like a trait system is built and
potentially something similar for modules (though I don't mind simply requiring modules to be written in
separate module files, if I do this, the language would still need some form of statement to import the
appropriate modules.)
